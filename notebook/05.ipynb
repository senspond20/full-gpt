      "To make Italian pasta, you will need the following ingredients:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 2 cups of all-purpose flour\n",
      "- 2 large eggs\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon of salt\n",
      "- Water (if needed)\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a step-by-step guide to making Italian pasta:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. On a clean surface or in a large mixing bowl, pour the flour and create a well in the center.\n",
      "2. Crack the eggs into the well and add the salt.\n",
      "3. Using a fork or your fingers, gradually mix the eggs and salt into the flour, incorporating a little at a time.\n",
      "4. Once the dough starts to come together, knead it with your hands until it forms a smooth and elastic ball. If the dough feels too dry, you can add a little water, teaspoon by teaspoon, until it reaches the desired consistency. If it's too sticky, add a little more flour.\n",
      "5. Once the dough is formed, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax and make the dough easier to work with.\n",
      "6. After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions. Take one portion and flatten it with your hands or a rolling pin until it's about 1/4 inch thick.\n",
      "7. If you have a pasta machine, pass the dough through the machine, starting with the widest setting and gradually reducing the thickness until you reach the desired thickness for your pasta. If you don't have a pasta machine, you can use a rolling pin to roll out the dough as thin as possible.\n",
      "8. Once the dough is rolled out, you can cut it into your desired pasta shape. For example, you can cut it into thin strips for spaghetti or fettuccine, or use a pasta cutter to create shapes like farfalle (bowtie) or ravioli.\n",
      "9. As you cut the pasta, dust it with flour to prevent sticking. You can also hang the pasta on a drying rack or lay it flat on a clean surface until you're ready to cook it.\n",
      "10. To cook the pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, which means it's cooked but still slightly firm to the bite. The cooking time will vary depending on the thickness and shape of the pasta, so it's best to taste it as it cooks.\n",
      "11. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and serve it with your favorite sauce or toppings.\n",
